## Inspiration and Encouragement
Django is big boi poopoo doodoo and will be difficult. We will need to get over the hurdle
of setting up the project and learning the complicated directory structure. I promise it will be
chad and epic and powerful once we can learn the basics. Just focus on what we need to do for
the next assignment and we'll learn as we go.
