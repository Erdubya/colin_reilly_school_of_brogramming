# Bonus Assignment 2

## Objective
1. Implement `insertion sort` and `selection sort`
2. Create a test runner function to run bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort on 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 random lists.
3. Also run the native python sort in your test as well to compare that pog algorithm.
4. Print the times of the experiment to the console.

### Extra poggers bonus to the bonus
4. Research radix/bucket sort, merge sort, and quick sort (this one is the fastest and most cursed).
5. Implement one of these three - merge and radix are probably the easiest to understand conceptually, all three are hard to implement. They are v fast though.

| algorithm       | Best         | Average     | Worst       |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| bubblesort      | Ω(n)         | θ(n^2)      | O(n^2)      |
| selection sort  | Ω(n^2)       | θ(n^2)      | O(n^2)      |
| insertion sort  | Ω(n)         | θ(n^2)      | O(n^2)      |
| radix sort      | Ω(nk)        | θ(nk)       | O(nk)       |
| bucket sort     | Ω(n+k)       | θ(n+k)      | O(n^2)      |
| merge sort      | Ω(n log(n))  | θ(n log(n)) | O(n log(n)) |
| quick sort      | Ω(n log(n))  | θ(n log(n)) | O(n^2)      |
